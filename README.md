# Progamming_Bootcamp

This repository contains the 
exercises that I have done during the Hague Tech programming Bootcamp.

The bootcamp was held in 5 intensive days. In each day we learned a new thing and delivered a small assignment as a `Processing` code.

## Day 1: Pastel flower generator

This code generates a random flower with pastel colors by each run.

## Day 2: Mushroom hunter

This code is a game in which the user needs to hunt the mushrooms to gain points! By eating each mushroom, the speed of mushrooms falling increases.
The character moves with WASD keys.

## Day 3: Magic pot

By clicking anywhere, you can plant a flower. The higher you click, the greener the plant would be, and the lower you click, the browner.

## Day 4&5: Naughty cat!

This is a two player game. One player plays with the mouse (called farmer) while the other player plays with WASD on the keyboard (called Naughty cat).
Naughty cat needs to eat plants to gain points. On the other hand, the farmer needs to plant, grow, and harvest flowers while avoiding the cat to eat them in order to gain points.

 - Farmer: click to plant, right click to grow and harvest
 - Naughty cat: WASD to move

The first player to reach 10 points, wins!
